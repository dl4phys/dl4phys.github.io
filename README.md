# DL4Phys - Deep learning for physicists

## What is this?

This is a collection of educational material to explain deep learning to physicists.  
It's for people who have studied natural sciences, and want to extend what they know to data science and machine learning.  
This is **not** intended to help apply deep learning techniques to solve physics problems. (But that's cool too.)

## Why?

Like many people today, my interest in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) comes
without formal training in data science or even its traditional inputs like statistics.  
I studied Physics as an undergrad.  Which means I learned my share of vector calculus and
linear algebra, which are also key ingredients to understanding ML.  Through many hours
and years of sweating through scientific journal papers and textbooks I barely understood,
I have gained a solid understanding of ML.  As the science of ML matures, the professional
demand for people skilled in applying it has exploded.  As such, I want to share this 
perspective of how to talk about ML to somebody with a background in physical science.
